Installing assemblathon.

(1) Download and install assemblaLib (this will involve installing cactus and sonLib).

(2) Place the directory containing assemblathon on your python path, i.e.
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:FOO
where FOO/assemblaLib is the path to the base directory of assemblaLib. 

(3) Compile the C code:
Modify the rootPath variable in the src/Makefile to point at where you installed cactus.
In the base directory type 'make all'
